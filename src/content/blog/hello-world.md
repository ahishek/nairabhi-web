Every developer blog in existence starts with a "Hello World" post. It's tradition. It's the law. It's written somewhere in the Developer's Handbook, probably right next to the requirement that all keyboard shortcuts must be memorized and all coffee must be cold or expensive (or both).

And yes, I'm following that tradition. But here's my twist: I'm fully aware that most developer blogs stop here. The author writes this one inspirational first post, promises themselves they'll be consistent, and then... nothing. Six months later they come back to update the "About" page with their new job title and that's it.

Will this be different? Probably not. But I'm going to pretend it will be.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is a mix of things I'm thinking about, things I've learned the hard way, and probably a few hot takes that will make me cringe when I reread them in two years.

Expect posts about:
- **Product Management** — because that's what I do now, and someone needs to explain why your favorite feature got cut
- **Building Things** — from Android apps to fintech products, I've built a lot of stuff
- **The Intersection of Tech and Business** — where engineering meets product meets "wait, why isn't this working?"
- **Occasional Hot Takes** — controversial opinions delivered with complete confidence despite my uncertainty

## Pro tip: Check out the Human/Agent toggle

By the way, if you scroll down to the bottom of this site, you'll see a neat little toggle. Go play with it. It's one of my favorite things about this site.

## Why This Looks Like a Terminal

I built this whole thing with a retro terminal aesthetic because I genuinely miss the days when my job involved shipping code. These days I spend more time in Google Docs and Figma than I do in actual terminals, and sometimes I just want to pretend I'm still a real engineer.

The green text, the monospace font, the blinking cursor — it's all very "1995 hacker movie" and I love it for that exact reason.

So here we are. Hello World. Welcome to my corner of the internet. Stick around if you want, or don't. Either way, I'll probably write my next post in 2027.
